Search for colors codes in a text file and easily copy them in the clipboard (usfull for dotfiles)

## Dependncies
This script is written in Python using GTK3. So you need to install PyGobject with pip:
```
pip install PyGobject
```
Or with your distro's package manager (usually `python-gobject` or `python3-gi`)


## Usage


## TODO
- Get alpha colors working
- Open files from argv
