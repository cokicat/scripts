# Wallpaper  
A script I made for my dotfiles.  
Choose an image from `~/Pictures` with [bemenu](https://github.com/Cloudef/bemenu), then link it to `~/wallpaper` and set it with `feh`.

## Dependencies
Make sure that the `feh` package is installed on your distro.

# Usage  
In your WM's config file, run `feh --bg-scale ~/wallpaper` at startup.
